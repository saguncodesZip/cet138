# CET138 ePortfolio (Front‑End Only)

Open `index.html` in your browser. The navbar links navigate to the five topic pages:
- `fullstackdevelopment.html`
- `html.html`
- `css.html`
- `js.html`
- `bootstrap.html`

All pages use Bootstrap 5 via CDN and share styles in `assets/css/styles.css` and scripts in `assets/js/main.js`.

## Hosting (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repo and upload the `fs-portfolio` folder contents.
2. In Repository Settings → Pages, choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
3. Wait a minute; your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

This project is aligned with the five sections required in your assignment brief.
